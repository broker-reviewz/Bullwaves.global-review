    <h1>Warning: Bullwaves.global is a Scam Broker</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Bullwaves.global</strong> presents itself as a professional trading platform, but it is actually an unlicensed and fraudulent broker designed to deceive traders and steal their money. Especially targeted are novice traders who are easily misled by promises of quick profits and high returns.
    </p>
    <p>
      This broker uses aggressive marketing strategies, fake testimonials, and unrealistic profit claims to lure victims into depositing funds. Once invested, clients quickly realize that withdrawing their money is impossible. Customer support becomes unresponsive or hostile, and accounts may even be blocked without explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Numerous reports and complaints from former users reveal a consistent pattern of deception and theft. The platform is not regulated by any credible financial authority, meaning there is no legal protection or recourse for victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re asking yourself, "<strong>is Bullwaves.global scam or legit?</strong>", the clear answer is that <strong>Bullwaves.global is a scam</strong>. Protect your investments by avoiding this fraudulent broker entirely.
